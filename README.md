For this challenge, we have evaluated the study results of tumors in mice and the effects of various drug treatments. 

I started by cleaning the data and combining it in one dataframe. 

After doing some initial statistical analysis, I created the various charts to illustrate the studies results. 
After the broad charting, I focused in on the drug regimen Capomulin. 

The file is in the Pymaceuticals folder, named pymaceuticals_solved.ipynb
